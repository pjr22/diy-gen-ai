 <h1>Soft Boiled Eggs: A Helpful Guide</h1>
 <p>Soft boiling an egg is a simple and easy process that can be done at home. Here are the steps to follow:</p>
 <ol>
 <li>Bring a pot of water to a simmer on the stovetop. Make sure the water is not too hot, as this can cause the egg to cook too quickly.</li>
 <li>Carefully place the egg into the simmering water. If you are using a large egg, you may want to add it to the pot with a slotted spoon to avoid breaking the egg.</li>
 <li>Let the egg cook for 3-5 minutes, depending on your desired level of doneness. For a soft boiled egg, you will want to cook it for around 3 minutes. For a firmer boiled egg, you can cook it for up to 5 minutes.</li>
 <li>Use a slotted spoon to carefully remove the egg from the water and place it in an ice bath to stop the cooking process. This will help the egg to cool down quickly and retain its moisture.</li>
 <li>Once the egg has cooled, crackle gently to peel off the shell. Start at the large end of the egg and work your way around to the small end.</li>
 <li>Enjoy your soft boiled egg! You can eat it on its own or use it in a variety of recipes such as salads, sandwiches, or breakfast dishes.</li>
